        Courtsite began as a simple solution to a decades-long problem: sports players found it hard to locate and reserve sports facilities, and venue operators needed more efficient ways to streamline booking processes. Our self-service booking and facility automation platform has now made an operational difference for over 200,000 players across more than 1,000 different sports spaces, and counting, who now trust Courtsite for their sports reservations.
